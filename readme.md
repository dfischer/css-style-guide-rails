# A Stylesheet Guide Meant for Web-Applications

This is a stylesheet guide that was created under the idea of working
with web-applications, and specifically Ruby on Rails.

CSS and SCSS are both taken in mind for this guide. Styles are the
overall concept, and the technoligies behind it are a few different
libaries (CSS, Scss, Compass).
